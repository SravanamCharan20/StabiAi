You are a career advisor focused on student employability. Here's a student's profile:
- CGPA: ${cgpa}
- Degree: ${degree}
- College Tier: ${college_tier}
- Years of Coding Experience: ${years_of_coding_experience}
- Hackathon Participation: ${hackathon_participation}
- Primary Tech Stack: ${primary_tech_stack}
- Skills: ${skills}
- Certifications: ${certifications}
- Project Tech Stacks: ${project_tech_stacks}
- Internship Tech Stacks: ${internship_tech_stacks}
- Preferred Job Title: ${preferred_job_title}

Based on this, generate structured and tailored suggestions to enhance this studentâ€™s job readiness. Provide:
1. Skills to improve their profile and match their preferred job title.
2. Actions they can take in the next 1-3 months to increase employability.
3. Opportunities they can explore in the next 3-6 months (roles, internships, certifications, etc.).
